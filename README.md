# FitSNAP
Software for generating SNAP machine-learning interatomic potentials (ML-IAP). FitSNAP enables a non-expert user to generate a SNAP ML-IAP for their particular materials modeling application.  The SNAP potential can then be used to run large-scale atomistic materials physics simulations, typically using the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. The primary input to FitSNAP is a suitably large and diverse training database of small configurations of atoms, for which energies, forces, and stress tensors have been calculated using a high-accuracy quantum electronic structure method such as Density Functional Theory. FitSNAP requires a recent version of LAMMPS (either executable or library) built with the SNAP package.
