### PyTorch neural network force fitting example.

Run the bash script with `./run.sh` to run FitSNAP and fit to forces.

See the `nn_force_check.ipynb` for a notebook that checks neural network forces calculated in PyTorch against finite difference forces, to ensure that we are calculating forces properly.
